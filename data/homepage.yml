  - title: "Slow Slimmer"
    description: "Each small batch of Backhome Foods™ entrees are slowly simmered to develop yummy goodness that cannot be replicated.  We take the time, so you don’t have to.  Simmering cooks, the food gently and slowly, allowing it to maintain its structure in ways that are impossible with boiling. If you’re cooking fish, simmering allows it to stay together without flaking apart; if you’re cooking meat, simmering keeps it tender and juicy instead of drying it out like boiling, which hardens the proteins.  Most importantly, simmering allows the various tastes to mingle and layer one over the other, creating a depth of flavor over time that can’t be fabricated."
